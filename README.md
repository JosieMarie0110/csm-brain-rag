# CS Brain

**AI-powered strategy assistant for Customer Success Managers**

CS Brain is a lightweight AI tool designed to help Customer Success Managers generate **strategic responses, risk analysis, and executive-ready messaging** based on Customer Success best practices.

The tool acts as a **CSM knowledge assistant**, helping translate complex customer situations into structured insights and actionable communication.

This project was built as part of a **Customer Success AI toolkit** designed to support real-world CS workflows such as account strategy, incident communication, and customer risk evaluation.

## Why This Project Exists

Customer Success Managers often need to quickly:

- assess customer health signals  
- craft executive-ready messaging  
- respond to incidents  
- align product usage with business outcomes  
- prepare for QBR / EBR discussions  

However, most tools focus on **product analytics**, not **strategic thinking and communication**.

**CS Brain bridges that gap** by helping CSMs structure their thinking into **clear, strategic outputs**.

---

## Key Features

**Structured Strategic Responses**

Transforms open-ended questions into clear, structured guidance aligned with Customer Success best practices.

**Multiple Response Formats**

Users can choose how they want the output structured, including:

- Strategic guidance  
- Executive summaries  
- Customer messaging  
- Playbooks and action plans  

**Customer Success Knowledge Assistant**

The system uses a knowledge base of Customer Success concepts to help generate responses aligned with common CS frameworks.

**Fast Idea Generation**

CSMs can quickly brainstorm messaging or strategy when preparing for:

- customer calls  
- renewal discussions  
- internal strategy meetings  
- executive updates
